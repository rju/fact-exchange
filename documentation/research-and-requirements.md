= Platform to support fact-based Online Communication =

# Motivation

Online discussions are a core element of political communication. Due to
increasing relevance of online platforms and social media, political parties and
lobbyists focus more effort on their online communication especially regarding
interactive platforms, e.g., twitter, faebook, and whatsApp. Thus, online
discussions face multiple threats from these highly organized parties, which
try to dominate the discussion and use fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), to
attack their political, economic, and social oponents. In this "game", groups
which are highly organized and possess excessive funding are in an advantage.
They can use, create, and pick content to support their arguments, which others
cannot do to the same magnitude. Especially, individuals cannot be experts in 
all disciplines and in all areas to an extend which allows them to answer to
claims made by think tanks. The key weakness of such individuals is the lack of
prepared knowledge and content they can access to counter manufactured lies,
twisted facts, and other rhetorical trickery used to attack them online.

To mitigate this issue, we will create a platform which allows to add questions
and answers to the system by different authors including experts, journalists
and online enthusiasts. In th following we describe the core features of such
system.

# Features

- The platform must support multiple users to be able to add and edit content.
- As the platform will contain important content which is used in political
  debates, it will be subject to attack. Therefore, security, scalability and
  stability of the application is of great importance.
- People should be able to browse and search the database without a login.
- To prevent denial of service attacks, the number of requests form the same
  address must be limited (or we must be able to limit it on demand).
- People should be able to submit new questions. Maybe also without a login.
  Essentially, this replicates behavior of stackexchange to some degree.
- Adding answers can only be done by logged in users.
- We need an curation process for answers new and edited.
- It must be possible to add material to answer cards.
- When links are included on social media, e.g., twitter, they should
  automatically view the core answer message.
- We need an automatic backup feature.
- To avoid editing issues, we need revision control.
