# Platform to support fact-based Online Communication

Online discussions are a core element of political communication. Due to
increasing relevance of online platforms and social media, political parties and
lobbyists focus more effort on their online communication, especially regarding
interactive platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. Thus, online
discussions face multiple threats from these highly organized **interest groups**,
which try to dominate the discussion and establish their narratives. They use a
wide variety of rhetoric methods to realize their goal. Beside ad hominem attacks
on protagonists, interest groups use fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), to attack
their political, economic, and social opponents.

These groups possess excessive funding are in an advantage over grassroot
movements and single actors.  They can use, create, and pick content to support
their arguments, which others cannot do to the same extend. Furthermore, interest
groups use statements and claims which can be addressed in two ways:
 * Request that they provide evidence for their claim.
 * Provide a supported counter argument including evidence.
The first approach only works properly in cases where the claim is **not** an
already established narrative. Even if the narrative is essentially false, e.g.,
the ocean is infinite, you have to provide evidence to counter this argument. 

Unfortunately, individuals cannot be experts in all disciplines and in all
areas to an extend which allows them to answer to claims made by interest
gorups. The key weaknesses of such individuals are the lack of prepared knowledge
and content they can access to counter false claims, and limited knowledge on
rhetorical techniques to avoid fair, informed and fact-based discussions. 

To mitigate the knowledge issue, we will create a platform which allows to add
questions and answers to the system by different authors including experts,
journalists and online enthusiasts.
